Weekend Project Instructions:

For consolidating the knowledge acquired in this week, the students should complete the following project:

1. Create a github repository for your project

2. Add all members of your group

3. Create a README.md file that describes your project

4. Extend the Chef GPT script with a prompt to give some sort of "personality" to your AI chef

    - For example, you could make your chef a "young and spirited Indian cook that loves to make Biryani" or a "wise and experienced Italian chef that loves to make pasta"


5. Create one script for each member of your group with a different prompt setting

To make things interesting, you could make each member of your group a different "personality" for the AI chef

For example, define a "focused and detailist vegan French chef" for one script and a "fun and energetic Mexican chef that loves spicy food" for another
Make the prompt in the script respond to three different possible inputs: suggesting dishes based on ingredients, giving recipes to dishes, or criticizing the recipes given by the user input

If the user passes a different prompt than these three scenarios as the first message, the AI should deny the request and ask to try again

If the user passes one or more ingredients, the AI should suggest a dish name that can be made with these ingredients

Try to make the AI suggest the dish name only, and not the recipe at this stage
If the user passes a dish name, the AI should give a recipe for that dish

If the user passes a recipe for a dish, the AI should criticize the recipe and suggest changes

Create a main.py script that will call the different scripts based on the user input

Experiment passing a list of ingredients for one script, then ask another script for a recipe for that dish, and then criticize the recipe given by the last script with a third script

Create a report with the results of the experiment and the different outputs of the AI chefs

Submit your project in the submission form
