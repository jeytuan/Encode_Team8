## Weekend Project Instructions

### Overview
This project is focused on consolidating the knowledge acquired this week by extending the Chef GPT script to give it a unique "personality".

### Objectives
- Create a GitHub repository for the project.
- Add all group members as contributors.
- Create and format a README.md file to describe the project.
- Each group member creates a script with a distinct AI chef personality.
- Implement AI chef responses to specific types of user inputs.

### Detailed Tasks
1. **Personality Extension:**
   - Examples:
     - "Young and spirited Indian cook specializing in Biryani."
     - "Wise Italian chef experienced in making pasta."
   - Each member's script should have a unique AI chef personality.
     - e.g., "Detail-oriented vegan French chef" vs. "Energetic Mexican chef who loves spicy food."

2. **Script Functionality:**
   - The AI chef script should respond to three types of inputs:
     1. Suggest dishes based on given ingredients.
     2. Provide recipes for specified dishes.
     3. Criticize and suggest improvements to user-provided recipes.
   - The AI should deny and prompt for re-input if the request doesn't match these scenarios.

3. **Main Script:**
   - `main.py` will call different personality scripts based on user input.
   - Example flow: List of ingredients ‚Üí Suggested dish ‚Üí Recipe ‚Üí Critique.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Create a report detailing the experiment's results and the different AI chefs' outputs.
